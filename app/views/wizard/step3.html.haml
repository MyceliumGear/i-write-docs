    %h1 Start accepting Bitcoin payments in three simple steps!
    %p This wizard will guide through the process of adding a Bitcoin payment option to your website. It's very simple and only requires you to have a Bitcoin wallet that supports BIP32 (Mycelium or Electrum) and access to your website.

  - else @gateway.site_type == "shopify"

    %b Since your website isn't built with either Wordpress or Shopify, you will need to insert the widget html code yourself. Here's what you should do:

    %ol
      %li Open your html page in text editor (such as Notepad, Notepad++, Vim, Emacs, Textmate or Sublime) and find a place where you would like the widget to appear.
      %li Generate the widget code below, paste it into the chosen place and save the file:

      .widget

        %label
          Set price:
          %input#widget_price(type="text")
        %label
          Set title:
          %input#widget_title(type="text")
        %input#widget_gateway_id{ type: "hidden", value: @gateway.straight_gateway_id }
        %span#widget_currency= @gateway.default_currency
        %button.small.unlockable#generate_widget Get code

        .generatedWidget= render partial: 'gateways/generated_widget'

      %li Upload that file onto your server
      %li Repeat for every page you would like the widget to appear on

    %h2 ...and that's it!
