    Your website is created using Shopify. Please follow these steps to install our payment widget onto your website:

      %li Step 1 describing how to open site admin panel and add a plugin
      %li Step 2 explaining how to check the widget is working

  - else @gateway.site_type == "shopify"

    %b Since your website isn't built with either Wordpress or Shopify, you will need to insert the widget html code yourself. Here's what you should do:

    %li Upload that file onto your server
    %li Repeat for every page you would like the widget to appear on

    %h2 ...and that's it!
