  %p
    Although being notified through a callback is the standard way to let your
    website know that order status has changed, it may sometimes not be enough.
    For example, your website may be down and may not be able to process the callback,
    even though it issued. And even though Mycelium Gear will try to issue new callback
    request to reach your website, it will only keep doing that for an hour, after which
    it will stop.

  %p
    Thus, it is important to have another reliable mechanism to check order status.
    However, you should only use it in case in which you suspect a callback may have
    missed you.

  %p To check the current status of the order, simply issue the following GET request:

  .code GET /gateways/:gateway_id/orders/1

  %p
    where <span class="code">:gateway_id</span> is the API id of your gateway you can look up
    on its info page. The response will return you a json similar to what a callback might
    have passed to you via params:

  .code
    {"status": 2,<br/>"amount":1,<br/>"address":"1NZov2nm6gRCGW6r4q1qHtxXurrWNpPr1q",<br/>"tid":"f0f9205e41bf1b79cb7634912e86bb840cedf8b1d108bd2faae1651ca79a5838",<br/>"id":1 }
