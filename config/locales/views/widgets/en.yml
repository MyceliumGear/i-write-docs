        header: Add widget products
        hint: |
          You can add multiple items that you wish to sell &mdash; they will be displayed in a dropdown box inside the widget. If you enter only one item, the widget will simply show that item's title and price (no dropdown). You can also configure the widget to work as a donation tool by leaving this field blank, which will cause it to only display a field to enter the desired donation amount. Checkbox "%{singular}" means that product quantity field will not be shown.
