         This wizard will guide through the process of adding the option to receive Bitcoin payments on your website.
          It's very simple and only requires you to have a Bitcoin wallet that supports BIP32 (Mycelium or Electrum) and access to edit your website.
          If instead of adding a widget, you'd like to integrate payments using our API, please consult our %{link_1} and %{link_2}.

        header: "Download the wallet"
        tip: >
         Before you start, you first need to download and install either Mycelium or Electrum wallet.
         These wallets support BIP32 pubkeys which Mycelium Gear can use to send your customer payments straight into your wallet.
