    hints:
      gateway:
        active: Unchecking this checkbox means new Orders will be turned down and customers will be unable to pay. This can be used when maintenance is being done.
        address_derivation_scheme: If you choose the wrong one, your wallet may not be able to detect the transactions. Make sure you know which wallet you are using.
        callback_url: When the status of the order changes (for example from NEW to PAID), Gear will send an http request to the following URL. The request will include additional order data (consult the documentation). This field may be left blank in which case no callback request will be sent.
        confirmations_required: Bitcoin confirmations for a transaction to be considered accepted by the gateway. Unless you have reasons to believe some of your customers are going to be frauds, we recommend setting it to 0.
        convert_currency_to: You can add more convertation options by configuring <a href="%{url}" target="_blank">new exchange</a> and refreshing this page.
        default_currency: If you select anything else but BTC, we're going to use one of the Bitcoin exchange rate providers to calculate the exchange rate at the time of purchase. Unless otherwise specified, you are still going to receive your money in BTC. Remember, that unless you choose BTC, at least one of the selected Bitcoin exchange rate providers must support that currency.
        merchant_name: In most cases, we assume it's the same as the Gateway's name
        name: This will to appear on the payment page for each customer to see
        orders_expiration_period: Number of seconds before the order expires due to customer not paying. Usually, default 15 minutes (900 seconds) - a current industry standard.
        pubkey: We're going to generate addresses for each order using this key. The key starts with "xpub". For security reasons, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE IT.
        regenerate_secret: Check this if you lost your gateway secret and would like to regenerate it. Note that all apps using your old secret will stop being able to access the API and all signatures will appear incorrect to them. The new secret will displayed to you after you click the "Update Gateway" button.
        test_mode: When test mode activated all transactions going throught TESTNET, for testing purpose only
        test_pubkey: Same as pubkey, but for TESTNET. You can't enable test mode without it.
        widget: Check this if you don't plan to use the API and integrate Gear into your online store, but simply would like to install a payment widget.
        after_payment_redirect_to: Enter the URL that will be used to redirect your customers upon successful payment completion.
        auto_redirect: When you select this checkbox, all users who have successful payment will be automatically redirected to the specified above URL.
