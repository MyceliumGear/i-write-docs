      gateway:
        name: This will to appear on the payment page for each customer to see
        confirmations_required: Bitcoin confirmations for a transaction to be considered accepted by the gateway. Unless you have reasons to believe some of your customers are going to be frauds, we recommend setting it to 0.
        pubkey: we're going to generate addresses for each order using this key. It starts with "xpub"
        default_currency: If you select anything else but BTC, we're going to use one of the Bitcoin exchanges to calculate the exchange rate at the time of purchase. Unless otherwise specified, you are still going to receive your money in BTC.
        callback_url: When the status of the order changes (for example from NEW to PAID), Gear will send an http request to the following URL. The request will include additional order data (consult the documentation). This field may be left blank in which case no callback request will be sent.
        active: Unchecking this checkbox means new Orders will be turned down and customers will be unable to pay. This can be used when maintenance is being done.
        merchant_name: In most cases, we assume it's the same as the Gateway's name
